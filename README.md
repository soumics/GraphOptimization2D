# GraphOptimization2D

This repository contains standalone c++ codes to build and optimize a 2D graph [pose (x, y), orientation aroud z axis (theta)], and the results are saved in a .g2o file. One has to give the right path of the file that contains (x, y, theta) and the right colum-numbers in the vector fileColumnIdx vector. For visualization using g2o_viewer, please uncomment the last few lines of code.
